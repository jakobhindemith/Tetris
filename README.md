# 🎮 Tetris (Pygame Edition)

A simple yet fun Tetris game built entirely with Python and Pygame.

🧱 This project was implemented by myself as a programming exercise. It features falling tetrominos, basic keyboard controls, and real-time rendering. The game logic and drawing are fully handled with Pygame and custom logic.

    Classic Tetris shapes: I, O, T, L, Z
    Real-time keyboard control using arrow keys
    Dynamic block movement and animation
    Grid-based rendering
    Modular code structure

🕹️ Controls
