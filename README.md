# 🎮 Tetris (Pygame Edition)

A simple fun Tetris game built entirely with Python and Pygame.

🧱 This project was implemented by myself as a programming exercise. It features falling tetrominos, basic keyboard controls, and real-time rendering. The game logic and drawing are fully handled with Pygame and custom logic.

    - Classic Tetris shapes: I, O, T, L, Z
    - Real-time keyboard control using arrow keys
    - Dynamic block movement and animation
    - Grid-based rendering
    - Modular code structure

🕹️ Controls

    ⬅️ Left Arrow – Move tetromino left

    ➡️ Right Arrow – Move tetromino right

    ⬆️ Up Arrow - Turn tetromino

    ⬇️ Down - Arrow increases falling speed
